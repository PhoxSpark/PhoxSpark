- Hi, I’m Luis Gracia, AKA @PhoxSpark
- I like to code, especially headburning big and complex algorithms. Also, I'm very nerdy with videogames.
- I want to learn more about anything and keep practicing my coding skills. Currently I'm polishing my Python and want to learn more about data analyisis.
- I've studied - *Microsystems and networks* and *Web Development focused on Bioinformatics*. For now, I'm done with official studies, but who knows!
- I've been part of Salvador Capella's team on the INB, in Barcelona Supercomputing Center.
- You can reach me on my personal mail: lgraciamorales@icloud.com
